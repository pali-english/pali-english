Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā,

### 18. Malavagga: Stains

Paṇḍupalāsova dānisi,  
Yamapurisāpi ca te upaṭṭhitā;  
Uyyogamukhe ca tiṭṭhasi,  
Pātheyyampi ca te na vijjati.  
  
Today you’re like a withered leaf,  
Yama’s men await you.  
You stand at the departure gates,  
yet you have no supplies for the road.  
  
So karohi dīpamattano,  
Khippaṁ vāyama paṇḍito bhava;  
Niddhantamalo anaṅgaṇo,  
Dibbaṁ ariyabhūmiṁ upehisi.  
  
Make an island of yourself!  
Swiftly strive, learn to be wise!  
Purged of stains, flawless,  
you’ll go to the divine realm of the noble ones.  
  
Upanītavayo ca dānisi,  
Sampayātosi yamassa santikaṁ;  
Vāso te natthi antarā,  
Pātheyyampi ca te na vijjati.  
  
You’ve journeyed the stages of life,  
and now you set out to meet Yama.  
Along the way there’s nowhere to stay,  
yet you have no supplies for the road.  
  
So karohi dīpamattano,  
Khippaṁ vāyama paṇḍito bhava;  
Niddhantamalo anaṅgaṇo,  
Na punaṁ jātijaraṁ upehisi.  
  
Make an island of yourself!  
Swiftly strive, learn to be wise!  
Purged of stains, flawless,  
you’ll not come again to rebirth and old age.  
  
Anupubbena medhāvī,  
thokaṁ thokaṁ khaṇe khaṇe;  
Kammāro rajatasseva,  
niddhame malamattano.  
  
A smart person would purge  
their own stains gradually,  
bit by bit, moment by moment,  
like a smith smelting silver.  
  
Ayasāva malaṁ samuṭṭhitaṁ,  
Tatuṭṭhāya tameva khādati;  
Evaṁ atidhonacārinaṁ,  
Sāni kammāni nayanti duggatiṁ.  
  
It is the rust born on the iron  
that eats away the place it arose.  
And so it is their own deeds  
that lead the overly-ascetic to a bad place.  
  
Asajjhāyamalā mantā,  
anuṭṭhānamalā gharā;  
Malaṁ vaṇṇassa kosajjaṁ,  
pamādo rakkhato malaṁ.  
  
Not reciting is the stain of hymns.  
The stain of houses is neglect.  
Laziness is the stain of beauty.  
A guard’s stain is negligence.  
  
Malitthiyā duccaritaṁ,  
maccheraṁ dadato malaṁ;  
Malā ve pāpakā dhammā,  
asmiṁ loke paramhi ca.  
  
Misconduct is a woman’s stain.  
A giver’s stain is stinginess.  
Bad qualities are a stain  
in this world and the next.  
  
Tato malā malataraṁ,  
avijjā paramaṁ malaṁ;  
Etaṁ malaṁ pahantvāna,  
nimmalā hotha bhikkhavo.  
  
But a worse stain than these  
is ignorance, the worst stain of all.  
Having given up that stain,  
be without stains, mendicants!  
  
Sujīvaṁ ahirikena,  
kākasūrena dhaṁsinā;  
Pakkhandinā pagabbhena,  
saṅkiliṭṭhena jīvitaṁ.  
  
Life is easy for the shameless.  
With all the rude courage of a crow,  
they live pushy,  
rude, and corrupt.  
  
Hirīmatā ca dujjīvaṁ,  
niccaṁ sucigavesinā;  
Alīnenāppagabbhena,  
suddhājīvena passatā.  
  
Life is hard for the conscientious,  
always seeking purity,  
neither clinging nor rude,  
pure of livelihood and discerning.  
  
Yo pāṇamatipāteti,  
musāvādañca bhāsati;  
Loke adinnamādiyati,  
paradārañca gacchati.  
  
Take anyone in this world  
who kills living creatures,  
speaks falsely, steals,  
commits adultery,  
  
Surāmerayapānañca,  
yo naro anuyuñjati;  
Idheva meso lokasmiṁ,  
mūlaṁ khaṇati attano.  
  
and indulges in drinking  
alcohol and liquor.  
Right here they dig up  
the root of their own self.  
  
Evaṁ bho purisa jānāhi,  
pāpadhammā asaññatā;  
Mā taṁ lobho adhammo ca,  
ciraṁ dukkhāya randhayuṁ.  
  
Know this, good sir:  
they are unrestrained and wicked.  
Don’t let greed and hate  
subject you to pain for long.  
  
Dadāti ve yathāsaddhaṁ,  
yathāpasādanaṁ jano;  
Tattha yo ca maṅku bhavati,  
paresaṁ pānabhojane;  
Na so divā vā rattiṁ vā,  
samādhimadhigacchati.  
  
The people give according to their faith,  
according to their confidence.  
If you get upset over that,  
over other’s food and drink,  
you’ll not, by day or by night,  
become immersed in samādhi.  
  
Yassa cetaṁ samucchinnaṁ,  
mūlaghaccaṁ samūhataṁ;  
Sa ve divā vā rattiṁ vā,  
samādhimadhigacchati.  
  
Those who have cut that out,  
dug it up at the root, eradicated it,  
they will, by day or by night,  
become immersed in samādhi.  
  
Natthi rāgasamo aggi,  
natthi dosasamo gaho;  
Natthi mohasamaṁ jālaṁ,  
natthi taṇhāsamā nadī.  
  
There is no fire like greed,  
no crime like hate,  
no net like delusion,  
no river like craving.  
  
Sudassaṁ vajjamaññesaṁ,  
attano pana duddasaṁ;  
Paresaṁ hi so vajjāni,  
opunāti yathā bhusaṁ;  
Attano pana chādeti,  
kaliṁva kitavā saṭho.  
  
It’s easy to see the faults of others,  
hard to see one’s own.  
For the faults of others  
are tossed high like chaff,  
while one’s own are hidden,  
as a cheat hides a bad hand.  
  
Paravajjānupassissa,  
niccaṁ ujjhānasaññino;  
Āsavā tassa vaḍḍhanti,  
ārā so āsavakkhayā.  
  
When you look for the flaws of others,  
always finding fault,  
your defilements only grow,  
you’re far from ending defilements.  
  
Ākāseva padaṁ natthi,  
samaṇo natthi bāhire;  
Papañcābhiratā pajā,  
nippapañcā tathāgatā.  
  
In the sky there is no track,  
there’s no true ascetic outside here.  
People enjoy proliferation,  
the Realized Ones are free of proliferation.  
  
Ākāseva padaṁ natthi,  
samaṇo natthi bāhire;  
Saṅkhārā sassatā natthi,  
natthi buddhānamiñjitaṁ.  
Malavaggo aṭṭhārasamo.  
  
In the sky there is no track,  
there’s no true ascetic outside here.  
No conditions last forever,  
the Awakened Ones are not shaken.  

### 19. Dhammaṭṭhavagga: The Just

Na tena hoti dhammaṭṭho,  
yenatthaṁ sāhasā naye;  
Yo ca atthaṁ anatthañca,  
ubho niccheyya paṇḍito.  
  
You don’t become just  
by passing hasty judgement.  
An astute person evaluates both  
what is pertinent and what is irrelevant.  
  
Asāhasena dhammena,  
samena nayatī pare;  
Dhammassa gutto medhāvī,  
“dhammaṭṭho”ti pavuccati.  
  
A wise one judges others without haste,  
justly and impartially;  
that guardian of the law  
is said to be just.  
  
Na tena paṇḍito hoti,  
yāvatā bahu bhāsati;  
Khemī averī abhayo,  
“paṇḍito”ti pavuccati.  
  
You’re not an astute scholar  
just because you speak a lot.  
One who is secure, free of enmity and fear,  
is said to be astute.  
  
Na tāvatā dhammadharo,  
yāvatā bahu bhāsati;  
Yo ca appampi sutvāna,  
dhammaṁ kāyena passati;  
Sa ve dhammadharo hoti,  
yo dhammaṁ nappamajjati.  
  
You’re not one who has memorized the teaching  
just because you recite a lot.  
Someone who directly sees the teaching  
after hearing only a little  
is truly one who has memorized the teaching,  
for they can never forget it.  
  
Na tena thero so hoti,  
yenassa palitaṁ siro;  
Paripakko vayo tassa,  
“moghajiṇṇo”ti vuccati.  
  
You don’t become a senior  
by getting some grey hairs;  
for one ripe only in age,  
is said to have aged in vain.  
  
Yamhi saccañca dhammo ca,  
ahiṁsā saṁyamo damo;  
Sa ve vantamalo dhīro,  
“thero” iti pavuccati.  
  
One who has truth and principle,  
harmlessness, restraint, and self-control,  
that wise one, purged of stains,  
is said to be a senior.  
  
Na vākkaraṇamattena,  
vaṇṇapokkharatāya vā;  
Sādhurūpo naro hoti,  
issukī maccharī saṭho.  
  
Not by mere eloquence,  
or a beautiful complexion  
does a person appear holy,  
if they’re jealous, stingy, and devious.  
  
Yassa cetaṁ samucchinnaṁ,  
mūlaghaccaṁ samūhataṁ;  
Sa vantadoso medhāvī,  
“sādhurūpo”ti vuccati.  
  
But if they’ve cut that out,  
dug it up at the root, eradicated it,  
that wise one, purged of vice,  
is said to be holy.  
  
Na muṇḍakena samaṇo,  
abbato alikaṁ bhaṇaṁ;  
Icchālobhasamāpanno,  
samaṇo kiṁ bhavissati.  
  
A liar and breaker of vows is no ascetic  
just because they shave their head.  
How on earth can one be an ascetic  
who’s full of desire and greed?  
  
Yo ca sameti pāpāni,  
aṇuṁthūlāni sabbaso;  
Samitattā hi pāpānaṁ,  
“samaṇo”ti pavuccati.  
  
One who stops all wicked deeds,  
great and small,  
because of stopping wicked deeds  
is said to be an ascetic.  
  
Na tena bhikkhu so hoti,  
yāvatā bhikkhate pare;  
Vissaṁ dhammaṁ samādāya,  
bhikkhu hoti na tāvatā.  
  
You don’t become a mendicant  
just by begging from others.  
One who has undertaken domestic duties  
has not yet become a mendicant.  
  
Yodha puññañca pāpañca,  
bāhetvā brahmacariyavā;  
Saṅkhāya loke carati,  
sa ve “bhikkhū”ti vuccati.  
  
But one living a spiritual life,  
who has banished both merit and evil,  
who wanders having assessed the world,  
is said to be a mendicant.  
  
Na monena munī hoti,  
mūḷharūpo aviddasu;  
Yo ca tulaṁva paggayha,  
varamādāya paṇḍito.  
  
You don’t become a sage by silence,  
while still confused and ignorant.  
The astute one holds up the scales,  
taking only the best,  
  
Pāpāni parivajjeti,  
sa munī tena so muni;  
Yo munāti ubho loke,  
“muni” tena pavuccati.  
  
and rejecting the bad;  
a sage becomes a sage by measuring.  
One who measures good and bad in the world,  
is thereby said to be a sage.  
  
Na tena ariyo hoti,  
yena pāṇāni hiṁsati;  
Ahiṁsā sabbapāṇānaṁ,  
“ariyo”ti pavuccati.  
  
You don’t become a noble one  
by harming living beings.  
One harmless towards all living beings  
is said to be a noble one.  
  
Na sīlabbatamattena,  
bāhusaccena vā pana;  
Atha vā samādhilābhena,  
vivittasayanena vā.  
  
Not by precepts and observances,  
nor by much learning,  
nor by meditative immersion,  
nor by living in seclusion,  
  
Phusāmi nekkhammasukhaṁ,  
aputhujjanasevitaṁ;  
Bhikkhu vissāsamāpādi,  
appatto āsavakkhayaṁ.  
Dhammaṭṭhavaggo ekūnavīsatimo.  
  
do I experience the bliss of renunciation  
not frequented by ordinary people.  
A mendicant cannot rest confident  
without attaining the end of defilements.  

### 20. Maggavagga: The Path

Maggānaṭṭhaṅgiko seṭṭho,  
saccānaṁ caturo padā;  
Virāgo seṭṭho dhammānaṁ,  
dvipadānañca cakkhumā.  
  
Of paths, the eightfold is the best;  
of truths, the four statements;  
dispassion is the best of things,  
and the Seer is the best of humans.  
  
Eseva maggo natthañño,  
Dassanassa visuddhiyā;  
Etañhi tumhe paṭipajjatha,  
Mārassetaṁ pamohanaṁ.  
  
This is the path, there is no other  
for the purification of vision.  
You all must practice this,  
it is the way to baffle Māra.  
  
Etañhi tumhe paṭipannā,  
dukkhassantaṁ karissatha;  
Akkhāto vo mayā maggo,  
aññāya sallakantanaṁ.  
  
When you all are practicing this,  
you will make an end of suffering.  
I have explained the path to you  
for extracting the thorn with wisdom.  
  
Tumhehi kiccamātappaṁ,  
akkhātāro tathāgatā;  
Paṭipannā pamokkhanti,  
jhāyino mārabandhanā.  
  
You yourselves must do the work,  
the Realized Ones just show the way.  
Meditators practicing absorption  
are released from Māra’s bonds.  
  
“Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā”ti,  
yadā paññāya passati;  
Atha nibbindati dukkhe,  
esa maggo visuddhiyā.  
  
All conditions are impermanent—  
when this is seen with wisdom,  
one grows disillusioned with suffering:  
this is the path to purity.  
  
“Sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā”ti,  
yadā paññāya passati;  
Atha nibbindati dukkhe,  
esa maggo visuddhiyā.  
  
All conditions are suffering—  
when this is seen with wisdom,  
one grows disillusioned with suffering:  
this is the path to purity.  
  
“Sabbe dhammā anattā”ti,  
yadā paññāya passati;  
Atha nibbindati dukkhe,  
esa maggo visuddhiyā.  
  
All things are not-self—  
when this is seen with wisdom,  
one grows disillusioned with suffering:  
this is the path to purity.  
  
Uṭṭhānakālamhi anuṭṭhahāno,  
Yuvā balī ālasiyaṁ upeto;  
Saṁsannasaṅkappamano kusīto,  
Paññāya maggaṁ alaso na vindati.  
  
They don’t get going when it’s time to start;  
they’re young and strong, but given to sloth.  
Their mind depressed in sunken thought,  
lazy and slothful, they can’t discern the path.  
  
Vācānurakkhī manasā susaṁvuto,  
Kāyena ca nākusalaṁ kayirā;  
Ete tayo kammapathe visodhaye,  
Ārādhaye maggamisippaveditaṁ.  
  
Guarded in speech, restrained in mind,  
doing no unskillful bodily deed.  
Purify these three ways of performing deeds,  
and win the path known to hermits.  
  
Yogā ve jāyatī bhūri,  
ayogā bhūrisaṅkhayo;  
Etaṁ dvedhāpathaṁ ñatvā,  
bhavāya vibhavāya ca;  
Tathāttānaṁ niveseyya,  
yathā bhūri pavaḍḍhati.  
  
From meditation springs wisdom,  
without meditation, wisdom ends.  
Knowing these two paths—  
of progress and decline—  
you should conduct yourself  
so that wisdom grows.  
  
Vanaṁ chindatha mā rukkhaṁ,  
vanato jāyate bhayaṁ;  
Chetvā vanañca vanathañca,  
nibbanā hotha bhikkhavo.  
  
Cut down the jungle, not just a tree;  
from the jungle springs fear.  
Having cut down jungle and vine,  
be free of jungles, mendicants!  
  
Yāva hi vanatho na chijjati,  
Aṇumattopi narassa nārisu;  
Paṭibaddhamanova tāva so,  
Vaccho khīrapakova mātari.  
  
So long as the vine, no matter how small,  
that ties a man to women is not cut,  
his mind remains trapped,  
like a calf suckling its mother.  
  
Ucchinda sinehamattano,  
Kumudaṁ sāradikaṁva pāṇinā;  
Santimaggameva brūhaya,  
Nibbānaṁ sugatena desitaṁ.  
  
Cut out fondness for oneself,  
like plucking an autumn lotus.  
Foster only the path to peace,  
the quenching the Holy One taught.  
  
Idha vassaṁ vasissāmi,  
idha hemantagimhisu;  
Iti bālo vicinteti,  
antarāyaṁ na bujjhati.  
  
“Here I will stay for the rains;  
here for winter, here the summer”;  
thus the fool thinks,  
not realizing the danger.  
  
Taṁ puttapasusammattaṁ,  
byāsattamanasaṁ naraṁ;  
Suttaṁ gāmaṁ mahoghova,  
maccu ādāya gacchati.  
  
As a mighty flood sweeps away a sleeping village,  
death steals away a man  
who dotes on children and cattle,  
his mind caught up in them.  
  
Na santi puttā tāṇāya,  
na pitā nāpi bandhavā;  
Antakenādhipannassa,  
natthi ñātīsu tāṇatā.  
  
Children provide you no shelter,  
nor does father, nor relatives.  
When you’re seized by the terminator,  
there’s no shelter in family.  
  
Etamatthavasaṁ ñatvā,  
paṇḍito sīlasaṁvuto;  
Nibbānagamanaṁ maggaṁ,  
khippameva visodhaye.  
Maggavaggo vīsatimo.  
  
Knowing the reason for this,  
astute, and ethically restrained,  
one would quickly clear the path  
that leads to extinguishment.  

### 21. Pakiṇṇakavagga: Miscellaneous

Mattāsukhapariccāgā,  
passe ce vipulaṁ sukhaṁ;  
Caje mattāsukhaṁ dhīro,

by imposing suffering on others.

constant mindfulness of the body,  
don’t cultivate what should not be done,  
but always do what should be done.  
Mindful and aware,  
their defilements come to an end.

Going forth is hard, it’s hard to be happy;  
life at home is hard too, and painful,

so don’t be a traveler,  
don’t be prey to pain.

Sitting alone, sleeping alone,  
tirelessly wandering alone;  
one who tames themselves alone  
would delight within a forest.  

### 22. Nirayavagga: Hell

Abhūtavādī nirayaṁ upeti,  
Yo vāpi katvā na karomi cāha;  
Ubhopi te pecca samā bhavanti,  
Nihīnakammā manujā parattha.  
  
A liar goes to hell,  
as does one who denies what they did.  
Both are equal in the hereafter,  
those men of base deeds.  
  
Kāsāvakaṇṭhā bahavo,  
pāpadhammā asaññatā;  
Pāpā pāpehi kammehi,  
nirayaṁ te upapajjare.  
  
Many who wrap their necks in ocher robes  
are unrestrained and wicked.  
Being wicked, they are reborn in hell  
due to their bad deeds.  
  
Seyyo ayoguḷo bhutto,  
tatto aggisikhūpamo;  
Yañce bhuñjeyya dussīlo,  
raṭṭhapiṇḍamasaññato.  
  
It’d be better for the immoral and unrestrained  
to eat an iron ball,  
scorching, like a burning flame,  
than to eat the nation’s alms.  
  
Cattāri ṭhānāni naro pamatto,  
Āpajjati paradārūpasevī;  
Apuññalābhaṁ na nikāmaseyyaṁ,  
Nindaṁ tatīyaṁ nirayaṁ catutthaṁ.  
  
Four things befall a heedless man  
who sleeps with another’s wife:  
bad karma, poor sleep,  
ill-repute, and rebirth in hell.  
  
Apuññalābho ca gatī ca pāpikā,  
Bhītassa bhītāya ratī ca thokikā;  
Rājā ca daṇḍaṁ garukaṁ paṇeti,  
Tasmā naro paradāraṁ na seve.  
  
He accrues bad karma and is reborn in a bad place,  
all so a frightened couple may snatch a moment’s pleasure,  
for which rulers impose a heavy punishment.  
That’s why a man should not sleep with another’s wife.  
  
Kuso yathā duggahito,  
hatthamevānukantati;  
Sāmaññaṁ dupparāmaṭṭhaṁ,  
nirayāyupakaḍḍhati.  
  
When kusa grass is wrongly grasped  
it only cuts the hand.  
So too, the ascetic life, when wrongly taken,  
drags you to hell.  
  
Yaṁ kiñci sithilaṁ kammaṁ,  
saṅkiliṭṭhañca yaṁ vataṁ;  
Saṅkassaraṁ brahmacariyaṁ,  
na taṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Any lax act,  
any corrupt observance,  
or suspicious spiritual life,  
is not very fruitful.  
  
Kayirā ce kayirāthenaṁ,  
daḷhamenaṁ parakkame;  
Sithilo hi paribbājo,  
bhiyyo ākirate rajaṁ.  
  
If one is to do what should be done,  
one should staunchly strive.  
For the life gone forth when laxly led  
just stirs up dust all the more.  
  
Akataṁ dukkaṭaṁ seyyo,  
pacchā tappati dukkaṭaṁ;  
Katañca sukataṁ seyyo,  
yaṁ katvā nānutappati.  
  
A bad deed is better left undone,  
for it will plague you later on.  
A good deed is better done,  
one that does not plague you.  
  
Nagaraṁ yathā paccantaṁ,  
guttaṁ santarabāhiraṁ;  
Evaṁ gopetha attānaṁ,  
khaṇo vo mā upaccagā;  
Khaṇātītā hi socanti,  
nirayamhi samappitā.  
  
As a frontier city  
is guarded inside and out,  
so you should ward yourselves—  
don’t let the moment pass you by.  
For if you miss your moment  
you’ll grieve when sent to hell.  
  
Alajjitāye lajjanti,  
lajjitāye na lajjare;  
Micchādiṭṭhisamādānā,  
sattā gacchanti duggatiṁ.  
  
Unashamed of what is shameful,  
ashamed of what is not shameful;  
beings who uphold wrong view  
go to a bad place.  
  
Abhaye bhayadassino,  
bhaye cābhayadassino;  
Micchādiṭṭhisamādānā,  
sattā gacchanti duggatiṁ.  
  
Seeing danger where there is none,  
and blind to the actual danger,  
beings who uphold wrong view  
go to a bad place.  
  
Avajje vajjamatino,  
vajje cāvajjadassino;  
Micchādiṭṭhisamādānā,  
sattā gacchanti duggatiṁ.  
  
Seeing fault where there is none,  
and blind to the actual fault,  
beings who uphold wrong view  
go to a bad place.  
  
Vajjañca vajjato ñatvā,  
avajjañca avajjato;  
Sammādiṭṭhisamādānā,  
sattā gacchanti suggatiṁ.  
  
Knowing a fault as a fault  
and the faultless as faultless,  
beings who uphold right view  
go to a good place.  

### 23. Nāgavagga: Elephants

Ahaṁ nāgova saṅgāme,  
cāpato patitaṁ saraṁ;  
Ativākyaṁ titikkhissaṁ,  
dussīlo hi bahujjano.  
  
Like an elephant struck  
with arrows in battle,  
I shall put up with abuse,  
for so many folk are badly behaved.  
  
Dantaṁ nayanti samitiṁ,  
dantaṁ rājābhirūhati;  
Danto seṭṭho manussesu,  
yotivākyaṁ titikkhati.  
  
The well-tamed beast is the one led to the crowd;  
the tamed elephant’s the one the king mounts;  
the tamed person who endures abuse  
is the best of human beings.  
  
Varamassatarā dantā,  
ājānīyā ca sindhavā;  
Kuñjarā ca mahānāgā,  
attadanto tato varaṁ.  
  
Those who have tamed themselves are better  
than fine tamed mules,  
thoroughbreds from Sindh,  
or giant tuskers.  
  
Na hi etehi yānehi,  
gaccheyya agataṁ disaṁ;  
Yathāttanā sudantena,  
danto dantena gacchati.  
  
For not on those mounts  
would you go to the untrodden place,  
whereas, with the help of one whose self is well tamed,  
you go there, tamed by the tamed.  
  
Dhanapālo nāma kuñjaro,  
Kaṭukabhedano dunnivārayo;  
Baddho kabaḷaṁ na bhuñjati,  
Sumarati nāgavanassa kuñjaro.  
  
The tusker named Dhanapāla  
is musky in rut, hard to control.  
Bound, he eats not a bite,  
for he misses the elephant forest.  
  
Middhī yadā hoti mahagghaso ca,  
Niddāyitā samparivattasāyī;  
Mahāvarāhova nivāpapuṭṭho,  
Punappunaṁ gabbhamupeti mando.  
  
One who gets drowsy from overeating,  
fond of sleep, rolling round the bed  
like a great hog stuffed with grain:  
that idiot is reborn again and again.  
  
Idaṁ pure cittamacāri cārikaṁ,  
Yenicchakaṁ yatthakāmaṁ yathāsukhaṁ;  
Tadajjahaṁ niggahessāmi yoniso,  
Hatthippabhinnaṁ viya aṅkusaggaho.  
  
In the past my mind wandered  
how it wished, where it liked, as it pleased.  
Now I’ll carefully guide it,  
as a trainer with a hook guides a rutting elephant.  
  
Appamādaratā hotha,  
sacittamanurakkhatha;  
Duggā uddharathattānaṁ,  
paṅke sannova kuñjaro.  
  
Delight in diligence!  
Take good care of your mind!  
Pull yourself out of this pit,  
like an elephant sunk in a bog.  
  
Sace labhetha nipakaṁ sahāyaṁ,  
Saddhiṁ caraṁ sādhuvihāridhīraṁ;  
Abhibhuyya sabbāni parissayāni,  
Careyya tenattamano satīmā.  
  
If you find an alert companion,  
a wise and virtuous friend,  
then, overcoming all adversities,  
wander with them, joyful and mindful.  
  
No ce labhetha nipakaṁ sahāyaṁ,  
Saddhiṁ caraṁ sādhuvihāridhīraṁ;  
Rājāva raṭṭhaṁ vijitaṁ pahāya,  
Eko care mātaṅgaraññeva nāgo.  
  
If you find no alert companion,  
no wise and virtuous friend,  
then, like a king who flees his conquered realm,  
wander alone like a tusker in the wilds.  
  
Ekassa caritaṁ seyyo,  
Natthi bāle sahāyatā;  
Eko care na ca pāpāni kayirā,  
Appossukko mātaṅgaraññeva nāgo.  
  
It’s better to wander alone,  
there’s no fellowship with fools.  
Wander alone and do no wrong,  
at ease like a tusker in the wilds.  
  
Atthamhi jātamhi sukhā sahāyā,  
Tuṭṭhī sukhā yā itarītarena;  
Puññaṁ sukhaṁ jīvitasaṅkhayamhi,  
Sabbassa dukkhassa sukhaṁ pahānaṁ.  
  
A friend in need is a blessing;  
it’s a blessing to be content with whatever;  
good deeds are a blessing at the end of life,  
and giving up all suffering is a blessing.  
  
Sukhā matteyyatā loke,  
atho petteyyatā sukhā;  
Sukhā sāmaññatā loke,  
atho brahmaññatā sukhā.  
  
In this world it’s a blessing to serve  
one’s mother and one’s father.  
And it’s a blessing also to serve  
ascetics and brahmins.  
  
Sukhaṁ yāva jarā sīlaṁ,  
sukhā saddhā patiṭṭhitā;  
Sukho paññāya paṭilābho,  
pāpānaṁ akaraṇaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
It’s a blessing to keep precepts until you grow old;  
a blessing to be grounded in faith;  
the getting of wisdom’s a blessing;  
and it’s a blessing to avoid doing wrong.  

### 24. Taṇhāvagga: Craving

Manujassa pamattacārino,  
Taṇhā vaḍḍhati māluvā viya;  
So plavatī hurā huraṁ,  
Phalamicchaṁva vanasmi vānaro.  
  
When a person lives heedlessly,  
craving grows in them like a parasitic creeper.  
They jump from life to life, like a monkey  
greedy for fruit in a forest grove.  
  
Yaṁ esā sahate jammī,  
taṇhā loke visattikā;  
Sokā tassa pavaḍḍhanti,  
abhivaṭṭhaṁva bīraṇaṁ.  
  
Whoever is beaten by this wretched craving,  
this attachment to the world,  
their sorrow grows,  
like grass in the rain.  
  
Yo cetaṁ sahate jammiṁ,  
taṇhaṁ loke duraccayaṁ;  
Sokā tamhā papatanti,  
udabinduva pokkharā.  
  
But whoever prevails over this wretched craving,  
so hard to get over in the world,  
their sorrows fall from them,  
like a drop from a lotus-leaf.  
  
Taṁ vo vadāmi bhaddaṁ vo,  
yāvantettha samāgatā;  
Taṇhāya mūlaṁ khaṇatha,  
usīratthova bīraṇaṁ;  
Mā vo naḷaṁva sotova,  
māro bhañji punappunaṁ.  
  
I say this to you, good people,  
all those who have gathered here:  
dig up the root of craving,  
as you’d dig up grass in search of roots.  
Don’t let Māra break you again and again,  
like a stream breaking a reed.  
  
Yathāpi mūle anupaddave daḷhe,  
Chinnopi rukkho punareva rūhati;  
Evampi taṇhānusaye anūhate,  
Nibbattatī dukkhamidaṁ punappunaṁ.  
  
A tree grows back even when cut down,  
so long as its roots are healthy;  
suffering springs up again and again,  
so long as the tendency to craving is not pulled out.  
  
Yassa chattiṁsati sotā,  
manāpasavanā bhusā;  
Mahāvahanti duddiṭṭhiṁ,  
saṅkappā rāganissitā.  
  
A person of low views  
in whom the thirty-six streams  
that flow to pleasure are mighty,  
is swept away by lustful thoughts.  
  
Savanti sabbadhi sotā,  
latā uppajja tiṭṭhati;  
Tañca disvā lataṁ jātaṁ,  
mūlaṁ paññāya chindatha.  
  
The streams flow everywhere;  
a weed springs up and remains.  
Seeing this weed that has been born,  
cut the root with wisdom.  
  
Saritāni sinehitāni ca,  
Somanassāni bhavanti jantuno;  
Te sātasitā sukhesino,  
Te ve jātijarūpagā narā.  
  
A persons’s joys  
flow from senses and cravings.  
Seekers of happiness, bent on pleasure,  
continue to be reborn and grow old.  
  
Tasiṇāya purakkhatā pajā,  
Parisappanti sasova bandhito;  
Saṁyojanasaṅgasattakā,  
Dukkhamupenti punappunaṁ cirāya.  
  
People governed by thirst,  
crawl about like a trapped rabbit.  
Bound and fettered, for a long time  
they return to pain time and again.  
  
Tasiṇāya purakkhatā pajā,  
Parisappanti sasova bandhito;  
Tasmā tasiṇaṁ vinodaye,  
Ākaṅkhanta virāgamattano.  
  
People governed by thirst,  
crawl about like a trapped rabbit.  
That’s why one who longs for dispassion  
should dispel thirst.  
  
Yo nibbanatho vanādhimutto,  
Vanamutto vanameva dhāvati;  
Taṁ puggalametha passatha,  
Mutto bandhanameva dhāvati.  
  
Rejecting the household jungle, they set out for the real jungle,  
then they run right back to the jungle they left behind.  
Just look at this person!  
Freed, they run to bondage.  
  
Na taṁ daḷhaṁ bandhanamāhu dhīrā,  
Yadāyasaṁ dārujapabbajañca;  
Sārattarattā maṇikuṇḍalesu,  
Puttesu dāresu ca yā apekkhā.  
  
The wise say that shackle is not strong  
that’s made of iron, wood, or knots.  
But obsession with jeweled earrings,  
concern for your partners and children:  
  
Etaṁ daḷhaṁ bandhanamāhu dhīrā,  
Ohārinaṁ sithilaṁ duppamuñcaṁ;  
Etampi chetvāna paribbajanti,  
Anapekkhino kāmasukhaṁ pahāya.  
  
this, say the wise, is a strong shackle  
dragging the indulgent down, hard to escape.  
Having cut this one too they go forth,  
unconcerned, having given up sensual pleasures.  
  
Ye rāgarattānupatanti sotaṁ,  
Sayaṅkataṁ makkaṭakova jālaṁ;  
Etampi chetvāna vajanti dhīrā,  
Anapekkhino sabbadukkhaṁ pahāya.  
  
Besotted by lust they fall into the stream,  
like a spider caught in the web she wove.  
The wise proceed, having cut this one too,  
unconcerned, having given up all suffering.  
  
Muñca pure muñca pacchato,  
Majjhe muñca bhavassa pāragū;  
Sabbattha vimuttamānaso,  
Na punaṁ jātijaraṁ upehisi.  
  
Let go of the past, let go of the future,  
let go of the present, having gone beyond rebirth.  
With your heart freed in every respect,  
you’ll not come again to rebirth and old age.  
  
Vitakkamathitassa jantuno,  
Tibbarāgassa subhānupassino;  
Bhiyyo taṇhā pavaḍḍhati,  
Esa kho daḷhaṁ karoti bandhanaṁ.  
  
For a person crushed by thoughts,  
very lustful, focusing on beauty,  
their craving grows and grows,  
tying them with a stout bond.  
  
Vitakkūpasame ca yo rato,  
Asubhaṁ bhāvayate sadā sato;  
Esa kho byanti kāhiti,  
Esa checchati mārabandhanaṁ.  
  
But one who loves to calm their thoughts,  
developing perception of ugliness, ever mindful,  
will surely eliminate that craving,  
cutting off the bonds of Māra.  
  
Niṭṭhaṅgato asantāsī,  
vītataṇho anaṅgaṇo;  
Acchindi bhavasallāni,  
antimoyaṁ samussayo.  
  
One who is confident, unafraid,  
rid of craving, free of blemish,  
having struck down the arrows flying to future lives,  
this bag of bones is their last.  
  
Vītataṇho anādāno,  
Niruttipadakovido;  
Akkharānaṁ sannipātaṁ,  
Jaññā pubbāparāni ca;  
Sa ve “antimasārīro,  
Mahāpañño mahāpuriso”ti vuccati.  
  
Rid of craving, free of grasping,  
expert in the interpretation of terms,  
knowing the correct  
structure and sequence of syllables,  
they are said to be one who bears their final body,  
one of great wisdom, a great person.  
  
Sabbābhibhū sabbavidūhamasmi,  
Sabbesu dhammesu anūpalitto;  
Sabbañjaho taṇhakkhaye vimutto,  
Sayaṁ abhiññāya kamuddiseyyaṁ.  
  
I am the champion, the knower of all,  
unsullied in the midst of all things.  
I’ve given up all, freed in the ending of craving.  
Since I know for myself, whose follower should I be?  
  
Sabbadānaṁ dhammadānaṁ jināti,  
Sabbarasaṁ dhammaraso jināti;  
Sabbaratiṁ dhammarati jināti,  
Taṇhakkhayo sabbadukkhaṁ jināti.  
  
The gift of the teaching beats all other gifts;  
the taste of the teaching beats all other tastes;  
the joy of the teaching beats all other joys;  
one who has ended craving beats all suffering.  
  
Hananti bhogā dummedhaṁ,  
no ca pāragavesino;  
Bhogataṇhāya dummedho,  
hanti aññeva attanaṁ.  
  
Riches ruin an idiot,  
but not a seeker of the far shore.  
From craving for wealth, an idiot  
ruins themselves and others.  
  
Tiṇadosāni khettāni,  
rāgadosā ayaṁ pajā;  
Tasmā hi vītarāgesu,  
dinnaṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Weeds are the bane of crops,  
but greed is these folk’s bane.  
That’s why a gift to one rid of greed  
is so very fruitful.  
  
Tiṇadosāni khettāni,  
dosadosā ayaṁ pajā;  
Tasmā hi vītadosesu,  
dinnaṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Weeds are the bane of crops,  
but hate is these folk’s bane.  
That’s why a gift to one rid of hate  
is so very fruitful.  
  
Tiṇadosāni khettāni,  
mohadosā ayaṁ pajā;  
Tasmā hi vītamohesu,  
dinnaṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Weeds are the bane of crops,  
but delusion is these folk’s bane.  
That’s why a gift to one rid of delusion  
is so very fruitful.  
  
Tiṇadosāni khettāni,  
icchādosā ayaṁ pajā;  
Tasmā hi vigaticchesu,  
dinnaṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Weeds are the bane of crops,  
but desire is these folk’s bane.  
That’s why a gift to one rid of desire  
is so very fruitful.  

### 25. Bhikkhuvagga: Mendicants

Cakkhunā saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu sotena saṁvaro;  
Ghānena saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu jivhāya saṁvaro.  
  
Restraint of the eye is good;  
good is restraint of the ear;  
restraint of the nose is good;  
good is restraint of the tongue.  
  
Kāyena saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu vācāya saṁvaro;  
Manasā saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu sabbattha saṁvaro;  
Sabbattha saṁvuto bhikkhu,  
sabbadukkhā pamuccati.  
  
Restraint of the body is good;  
good is restraint of speech;  
restraint of mind is good;  
everywhere, restraint is good.  
The mendicant restrained everywhere  
is released from suffering.  
  
Hatthasaṁyato pādasaṁyato,  
Vācāsaṁyato saṁyatuttamo;  
Ajjhattarato samāhito,  
Eko santusito tamāhu bhikkhuṁ.  
  
One restrained in hand and foot,  
and in speech, the supreme restraint;  
happy inside, serene,  
solitary, content, I call a mendicant.  
  
Yo mukhasaṁyato bhikkhu,  
mantabhāṇī anuddhato;  
Atthaṁ dhammañca dīpeti,  
madhuraṁ tassa bhāsitaṁ.  
  
When a mendicant of restrained mouth,  
thoughtful in counsel, and stable,  
explains the text and its meaning,  
their words are sweet.  
  
Dhammārāmo dhammarato,  
dhammaṁ anuvicintayaṁ;  
Dhammaṁ anussaraṁ bhikkhu,  
saddhammā na parihāyati.  
  
Delighting in the teaching, enjoying the teaching,  
contemplating the teaching,  
a mendicant who recollects the teaching  
doesn’t decline in the true teaching.  
  
Salābhaṁ nātimaññeyya,  
nāññesaṁ pihayaṁ care;  
Aññesaṁ pihayaṁ bhikkhu,  
samādhiṁ nādhigacchati.  
  
A well-off mendicant ought not look down  
on others, nor should they be envious.  
A mendicant who envies others  
does not achieve immersion.  
  
Appalābhopi ce bhikkhu,  
salābhaṁ nātimaññati;  
Taṁ ve devā pasaṁsanti,  
suddhājīviṁ atanditaṁ.  
  
If a mendicant is poor in offerings,  
the well-to-do ought not look down on them.  
For the gods indeed praise them,  
who are tireless and pure of livelihood.  
  
Sabbaso nāmarūpasmiṁ,  
yassa natthi mamāyitaṁ;  
Asatā ca na socati,  
sa ve “bhikkhū”ti vuccati.  
  
One who has no sense of ownership  
in the whole realm of name and form,  
who does not grieve for that which is not,  
is said to be a mendicant.  
  
Mettāvihārī yo bhikkhu,  
pasanno buddhasāsane;  
Adhigacche padaṁ santaṁ,  
saṅkhārūpasamaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
A mendicant who meditates on love,  
devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,  
would realize the peaceful state,  
the blissful stilling of conditions.  
  
Siñca bhikkhu imaṁ nāvaṁ,  
sittā te lahumessati;  
Chetvā rāgañca dosañca,  
tato nibbānamehisi.  
  
Bail out this boat, mendicant!  
When bailed out it will float lightly.  
Having cut off desire and hate,  
you shall reach quenching.  
  
Pañca chinde pañca jahe,  
pañca cuttari bhāvaye;  
Pañca saṅgātigo bhikkhu,  
“oghatiṇṇo”ti vuccati.  
  
Five to cut, five to drop,  
and five more to develop.  
A mendicant who escapes five chains  
is said to have crossed the flood.  
  
Jhāya bhikkhu mā pamādo,  
Mā te kāmaguṇe ramessu cittaṁ;  
Mā lohaguḷaṁ gilī pamatto,  
Mā kandi “dukkhamidan”ti dayhamāno.  
  
Practice absorption, don’t be negligent!  
Don’t let the mind delight in the senses!  
Don’t heedlessly swallow a hot iron ball!  
And when it burns, don’t cry, “Oh, the pain!”  
  
Natthi jhānaṁ apaññassa,  
paññā natthi ajhāyato;  
Yamhi jhānañca paññā ca,  
sa ve nibbānasantike.  
  
No absorption for one without wisdom,  
no wisdom for one without absorption.  
But one with absorption and wisdom—  
they have truly drawn near to extinguishment.  
  
Suññāgāraṁ paviṭṭhassa,  
santacittassa bhikkhuno;  
Amānusī rati hoti,  
sammā dhammaṁ vipassato.  
  
A mendicant who enters an empty hut  
with mind at peace  
finds a superhuman delight  
as they rightly discern the Dhamma.  
  
Yato yato sammasati,  
khandhānaṁ udayabbayaṁ;  
Labhatī pītipāmojjaṁ,  
amataṁ taṁ vijānataṁ.  
  
Whenever they are mindful  
of the rise and fall of the aggregates,  
they feel rapture and joy:  
that is the deathless for one who knows.  
  
Tatrāyamādi bhavati,  
idha paññassa bhikkhuno;  
Indriyagutti santuṭṭhi,  
pātimokkhe ca saṁvaro.  
  
This is the very start of the path  
for a wise mendicant:  
guarding the senses, contentment,  
and restraint in the monastic code.  
  
Mitte bhajassu kalyāṇe,  
suddhājīve atandite;  
Paṭisanthāravutyassa,  
ācārakusalo siyā;  
Tato pāmojjabahulo,  
dukkhassantaṁ karissati.  
  
Mix with spiritual friends,  
who are tireless and pure of livelihood.  
Share what you have with others,  
being skillful in your conduct.  
And when you’re full of joy,  
you’ll make an end to suffering.  
  
Vassikā viya pupphāni,  
maddavāni pamuñcati;  
Evaṁ rāgañca dosañca,  
vippamuñcetha bhikkhavo.  
  
As a jasmine sheds  
its withered flowers,  
O mendicants,  
cast off greed and hate.  
  
Santakāyo santavāco,  
santavā susamāhito;  
Vantalokāmiso bhikkhu,  
“upasanto”ti vuccati.  
  
Calm in body, calm in speech,  
peaceful and serene;  
a mendicant who’s spat out the world’s bait  
is said to be one at peace.  
  
Attanā codayattānaṁ,  
paṭimaṁsetha attanā;  
So attagutto satimā,  
sukhaṁ bhikkhu vihāhisi.  
  
Urge yourself on,  
reflect on yourself.  
A mendicant self-controlled and mindful  
will always dwell in happiness.  
  
Attā hi attano nātho,  
ko hi nātho paro siyā;  
Attā hi attano gati,  
tasmā saṁyamamattānaṁ;  
Assaṁ bhadraṁva vāṇijo.  
  
Self is indeed the lord of self,  
for who else would be one’s lord?  
Self is indeed the home of self,  
so restrain yourself,  
as a merchant his thoroughbred steed.  
  
Pāmojjabahulo bhikkhu,  
pasanno buddhasāsane;  
Adhigacche padaṁ santaṁ,  
saṅkhārūpasamaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
A monk full of joy  
trusting in the Buddha’s teaching,  
would realize the peaceful state,  
the blissful stilling of conditions.  
  
Yo have daharo bhikkhu,  
yuñjati buddhasāsane;  
Somaṁ lokaṁ pabhāseti,  
abbhā muttova candimā.  
  
A young mendicant  
devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,  
lights up the world,  
like the moon freed from a cloud.  

### 26. Brāhmaṇavagga: Brahmins

Chinda sotaṁ parakkamma,  
kāme panuda brāhmaṇa;  
Saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ ñatvā,  
akataññūsi brāhmaṇa.  
  
Strive and cut the stream!  
Dispel sensual pleasures, brahmin.  
Knowing the ending of conditions,  
know the uncreated, brahmin.  
  
Yadā dvayesu dhammesu,  
pāragū hoti brāhmaṇo;  
Athassa sabbe saṁyogā,  
atthaṁ gacchanti jānato.  
  
When a brahmin  
has gone beyond two things,  
then they consciously  
make an end of all fetters.  
  
Yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā,  
pārāpāraṁ na vijjati;  
Vītaddaraṁ visaṁyuttaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
When one does not recognize the near shore,  
the far shore, or both;  
stress-free, detached,  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Jhāyiṁ virajamāsīnaṁ,  
katakiccamanāsavaṁ;  
Uttamatthamanuppattaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
Absorbed, rid of hopes,  
their task completed, without defilements,  
arrived at the highest goal:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Divā tapati ādicco,  
rattimābhāti candimā;  
Sannaddho khattiyo tapati,  
jhāyī tapati brāhmaṇo;  
Atha sabbamahorattiṁ,  
buddho tapati tejasā.  
  
The sun blazes by day,  
the moon glows at night,  
the aristocrat shines in armor,  
and the brahmin shines in absorption.  
But all day and all night,  
the Buddha shines with glory.  
  
Bāhitapāpoti brāhmaṇo,  
Samacariyā samaṇoti vuccati;  
Pabbājayamattano malaṁ,  
Tasmā “pabbajito”ti vuccati.  
  
A brahmin’s so-called because they have banished evil,  
an ascetic’s so-called since they live a serene life.  
One who has renounced all stains  
is said to be a “renunciant”.  
  
Na brāhmaṇassa pahareyya,  
nāssa muñcetha brāhmaṇo;  
Dhī brāhmaṇassa hantāraṁ,  
tato dhī yassa muñcati.  
  
One should never strike a brahmin,  
nor should a brahmin retaliate.  
Woe to the one who hurts a brahmin,  
and woe for the one who retaliates.  
  
Na brāhmaṇassetadakiñci seyyo,  
Yadā nisedho manaso piyehi;  
Yato yato hiṁsamano nivattati,  
Tato tato sammatimeva dukkhaṁ.  
  
Nothing is better for a brahmin  
than to hold their mind back from attachment.  
As cruelty in the mind gradually subsides,  
suffering also subsides.  
  
Yassa kāyena vācāya,  
manasā natthi dukkaṭaṁ;  
Saṁvutaṁ tīhi ṭhānehi,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
Who does nothing wrong  
by body, speech or mind,  
restrained in these three respects,  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Yamhā dhammaṁ vijāneyya,  
sammāsambuddhadesitaṁ;  
Sakkaccaṁ taṁ namasseyya,  
aggihuttaṁva brāhmaṇo.  
  
You should graciously honor  
the one from whom you learn the Dhamma  
taught by the awakened Buddha,  
as a brahmin honors the sacred flame.  
  
Na jaṭāhi na gottena,  
na jaccā hoti brāhmaṇo;  
Yamhi saccañca dhammo ca,  
so sucī so ca brāhmaṇo.  
  
Not by matted hair or family,  
or birth is one a brahmin.  
Those who have truth and principle:  
they are pure, they are brahmins.  
  
Kiṁ te jaṭāhi dummedha,  
kiṁ te ajinasāṭiyā;  
Abbhantaraṁ te gahanaṁ,  
bāhiraṁ parimajjasi.  
  
Why the matted hair, you fool,  
and why the skin of deer?  
The tangle is inside you,  
yet you polish up your outsides.  
  
Paṁsukūladharaṁ jantuṁ,  
kisaṁ dhamanisanthataṁ;  
Ekaṁ vanasmiṁ jhāyantaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
A person who wears robes of rags,  
lean, their limbs showing veins,  
meditating alone in the forest,  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Na cāhaṁ brāhmaṇaṁ brūmi,  
yonijaṁ mattisambhavaṁ;  
Bhovādi nāma so hoti,  
sace hoti sakiñcano;  
Akiñcanaṁ anādānaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
I don’t call someone a brahmin  
after the mother or womb they came from.  
If they still have attachments,  
they’re just someone who says “sir”.  
Having nothing, taking nothing:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Sabbasaṁyojanaṁ chetvā,  
yo ve na paritassati;  
Saṅgātigaṁ visaṁyuttaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
Having cut off all fetters  
they have no anxiety.  
They’ve got over clinging, and are detached:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Chetvā naddhiṁ varattañca,  
sandānaṁ sahanukkamaṁ;  
Ukkhittapalighaṁ buddhaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
They’ve cut the strap and harness,  
the reins and bridle too,  
with cross-bar lifted, they’re awakened:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Akkosaṁ vadhabandhañca,  
aduṭṭho yo titikkhati;  
Khantībalaṁ balānīkaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
Abuse, killing, caging:  
they endure these without anger.  
Patience is their powerful army:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Akkodhanaṁ vatavantaṁ,  
sīlavantaṁ anussadaṁ;  
Dantaṁ antimasārīraṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
Not irritable or stuck up,  
dutiful in precepts and observances,  
tamed, bearing their final body:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Vāri pokkharapatteva,  
āraggeriva sāsapo;  
Yo na limpati kāmesu,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
Like water from a lotus leaf,  
like a mustard seed off a pin-point,  
sensual pleasures slip off them:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Yo dukkhassa pajānāti,  
idheva khayamattano;  
Pannabhāraṁ visaṁyuttaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
They understand for themselves  
the end of suffering in this life;  
with burden put down, detached:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Gambhīrapaññaṁ medhāviṁ,  
maggāmaggassa kovidaṁ;  
Uttamatthamanuppattaṁ,

expert in the variety of paths;  
arrived at the highest goal:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.

anāgārehi cūbhayaṁ;  
Anokasārimappicchaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
Socializing with neither  
householders nor the homeless.  
A migrant with no shelter, few in wishes:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Nidhāya daṇḍaṁ bhūtesu,  
tasesu thāvaresu ca;  
Yo na hanti na ghāteti,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
They’ve laid aside violence  
against creatures firm and frail;  
not killing or making others kill:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Aviruddhaṁ viruddhesu,  
attadaṇḍesu nibbutaṁ;  
Sādānesu anādānaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.

extinguished among those who are armed,  
not taking among those who take:

along with conceit and contempt,  
like a mustard seed off the point of a pin:

and don’t offend anyone:

long or short,  
fine or coarse, beautiful or ugly:
